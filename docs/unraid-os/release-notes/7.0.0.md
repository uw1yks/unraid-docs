# Version 7.0.0-beta.2 2024-07-12

This version of Unraid OS includes significant improvements across all subsystems, while attempting to
maintain backward compatibility as much as possible.  For this reason, we determined it appropriate to
bump the version up to 7.0.  Be assured, this is still a free upgrade.

Special thanks to:

## Upgrading

### Known issues

This release is being published with the 6.8.12 Linux kernel which is at EOL. This is the latest kernel
supported by OpenZFS as of this date.  We anticipate OpenZFS support for kernels beyond 6.8 is imminent
and when available, we will update Unraid OS as well.  We consider this to be a *blocker* in releasing
Unraid OS v7.0.0-rc.1.

If you are using ZFS pools please take note of the following:

* You will see a warning about unsupported features in your existing ZFS pools. This is because the
version of ZFS in 7.0 is upgraded vs. 6.12 and contains new features.  This warning is harmless, meaning
your pool will still function normally.  In a future release we will be adding a mechanism to upgrade
your pools.
* New pools created in 7.0 will not mount in 6.12 due to ZFS not supporting downgrades.  There is no way
around this.
* If you decide to downgrade from 7.0 to 6.12 any previously existing hybrid pools will not
be recognized upon reboot into 6.12.  To workaround this, first click Tools/New Config in 7.0, preserving
all slots, then reboot into 6.12 and your hybrid pools should import correctly.
* If you create a 'special' ZFS subpool, the webGUI will incorrectly let you remove all devices of that
subpool and then remove the subpool, but doing this will render your pool unmountable. Once a 'special' is added,
ZFS does not support removing it. This will be fixed in a future release.
* You can define a 'spares' subpool but if a device fails ZFS will not automatically use one of the spares.
You could drop to command line and do it, but this will greatly complicate pool config, ie, don't do it.
This will be fixed in a future release.
* Currently unable to import TrueNAS pools. This will be fixed in a future release.
* There is a conflict with recent releases of Docker, ZFS, and the Linux Kernel. On **Settings > Docker**,
we recommend that you use a Docker image rather than a Docker directory. If you choose to use a directory,
avoid placing it on a ZFS pool (XFS or BTRFS are fine). If you have any of these symptoms,
you'll want to delete your Docker directory and [recreate in an image](../manual/docker-management.md#re-create-the-docker-image-file):
  * Call traces
  * Containers hanging
  * Extremely slow load times of the Docker page
  * Inability to update containers

Please see the [6.12.10 release notes](6.12.10.md#known-issues) for general known issues.

### Rolling back

See the warnings under **Known Issues** above.

The Dynamix File Manager, GUI Search, and Unlimited Width Plugin plugins are now built in to Unraid. If you rollback to an earlier version
you will need to reinstall those plugins to retain their functionality.

If you disabled the unRAID array we recommend enabling it again before rolling back.

If you previously had Outgoing Proxies setup using the Proxy Editor plugin or some other mechanism, you will need to re-enable that mechanism after rolling back.

After rolling back, make a dummy change to each WireGuard config to get the settings appropriate for that version of Unraid.

If rolling back earlier than 6.12.10, also see the [6.12.10 release notes](6.12.10.md#rolling-back).

## Storage

### unRAID array optional

You can now set the number of unRAID array slots to 'none'.  This will allow array Start without any
devices assigned to the unRAID array itself.

If you are running an all-SSD/NMVe server, we recommend assigning all devices
to one or more ZFS/BTRFS pools, since Trim/Discard is not supported with unRAID array devices.

To remove the unRAID array from an existing server, first unassign all Arry slots on Main page, and then
set the Slots to 'none'.

For new installs, the default number of slots to reserve for the unRAID array is now 'none'.

### Share secondary storage may be assigned to a pool

Shares can now be configured with pools for both primary and secondary storage, and mover will move
files between those pools.

### Can use 'mover' to empty an array disk

Mover can now be used to empty an array disk. With the array started, run this at a web terminal:

```bash
mover start -e diskN |& logger &  # where N is [1..28]
```

Mover will look at each top-level director (share) and then move files one-by-one to other disks
in the array, following the usual config settings (include/exclude, split-level, alloc method). Move
targets are restricted to just the unRAID array.

Watch the syslog for status. When the mover process ends, the syslog will show a list of files which
could not be moved:

* maybe file was in-use
* maybe file is at the top-level of /mnt/diskN
* maybe we ran out of space

Since ReiserFS is scheduled to be removed from the Linux kernel, the option to format a device with ReiserFS
has also been disabled.  You may use this mover function to empty an array disk prior to reformatting with
another file system.  We will add a webGUI button for this in a future release.

### Predefined shares handling

The Unraid OS Docker Manager is configured by default to use certain predefined shares:

* system - used to store Docker image layers in a loopback image stored in system/docker.
* appdata - used by Docker applications to store application data.

The Unraid OS VM Manager is configured by default to use certain predefined shares:

* system - used to store libvirt loopback image stored in system/libvirt
* domains - used to store VM vdisk images
* isos - used to store ISO boot images

When either Docker or VMs are enabled, the required predefined shares are created if necessary
according to these rules:

* if a pool named 'cache' is present, predefined shares are created with 'cache' as the Primary
storage with no Secondary storage.
* if no pool named 'cache' is present, the predefined shares are created with the first
alphabetically present pool as Primary with no Secondary storage.
* if no pools are present, the predefined shares are created on the unRAID array as Primary with no
Secondary storage.

### ZFS implementation

* Support Hybrid ZFS pools aka subpools
* Support recovery from multiple drive failures in a ZFS pool with sufficient protection
* Support LUKS encryption on ZFS pools and drives
* Set reasonable default profiles for new ZFS pools and subpools

### Other changes

* Spin up/down devices of a pool in parallel
* Add ability to change encryption phrase/keyfile for LUKS encrypted disks
* Introduce delay between creating GPT partition table and telling kernel to re-read to prevent "device or resource busy" error.
* Properly import pools created in previous releases
* Fix error when replaced device happens to have a LUKS header
* fix highwater allocation method in association with ZFS volumes
* Output syslog message if failure to create object due to insufficient free space
  * note: this may flood the system log

## VM Manager

Added support for VM clones, snapshots, and evdev passthru.

The VM editor now has a new read-only inline XML mode for advanced users, making it clear how the
GUI choices affect the underlying XML used by the VM.

Big thanks to @SimonF for his ongoing enhancements to VMs.

## Docker

To prevent "Docker fork bombs" we introduced a new setting, **Settings > Docker > Docker PID Limit** which
specifies the maximum number of Process ID's which any continer may have active (with default 2048).

If you have a container which requires more PID's you may either increase this setting, or you may override
for a specific container by adding, for example, `--pids-limit 3000` to the Docker
template *Extra Parameters* setting.

* Allow custom registry with a port specification
* Fix WG routes added to the correct interface (br0 or eth0 or bond0)
* Use "lazy unmount" unmount of docker image to prevent blocking array stop
* Updated to address multiple security issues (CVE-2024-21626, CVE-2024-24557)

* Permit NFSv4 mounts by default
* Upgraded to OpenSSL 3
* Allow ALL IPv4/IPv6 addresses as listener. This solves the issue when IPv4 or IPv6 addresses change dynamically
* Samba:
  * Add ipv6 listening address only when netbios is disabled
  * Fix MacOS unable to write 'flash' share and restore Time Machine compatibility (fruit changes)
* The VPN manager now adds all interfaces to WireGuard tunnels, make a dummy change to the tunnel after
upgrading or changing network settings to update WireGuard tunnel configs.

## webGUI

### Integrated Dynamix File Manager plugin

Click the file manager icon and navigate through your directory structure with ability to perform
common operations such as copy, move, delete, and rename files and directories.

### Integrated GUI Search plugin

Click the search icon on the Menu bar and type the name of the setting you are looking for.

### Outgoing Proxy Manager

If you previously used the Proxy Editor plugin or had an outgoing proxy setup for CA,
those will automatically be removed/imported. You can then adjust
them on **Settings > Outgoing Proxy Manager**.

For more details see the [manual](../manual/security/outgoing-proxy-manager.md).

Note: this feature is completely unrelated to any reverse proxies you may be using.

### Notification Agents

Notification agents xml are now stored as individual xml files, making it easier to
add notification agents via plugin.

See this [sample plugin](https://github.com/Squidly271/Wxwork-sample) by @Squid

### NTP Configuration

For new installs, a single default NTP server is set to 'time.google.com'.

If your server is using our previous NTP defaults of `time1.google.com`, `time2.google.com` etc,
you may notice some confusing NTP-related messages in your syslog. To avoid this, consider changing
to our new defaults: navigate to **Settings > Date & Time** and configure **NTP server 1** to
be `time.google.com`, leaving all the others blank.

Of course, you are welcome to use any time servers you prefer, this is just to let you know that we have
tweaked our defaults.

### Dashboard

* Add server date and time to dashboard, click the time to edit related settings
* Rework the **System** tile to clarify what is being shown, including tool tips
* Show useful content when dashboard tiles are minimized
* Fix browsers leaving dashboard visibility cookies in malformed state

* Display KB/MB/GB/TB written in SMART Attributes for SSDs
* Add 'SSD endurance remaining' SMART Attribute.
* Fix display of 'Accumulated power on time, hours:minutes xxxxx:yy' SMART attribute

### Other changes

* Support different warning/critical temperature thresholds for HDD/SSD/NVMe drives. NVMe thresholds are set automatically by the drive itself,
  see **Settings > Disk Settings** to set the thresholds for HDDs and SSDs. All can still be overridden for individual drives.
* Add **Settings > Local Console Settings** page with options for keyboard layout, screen blank time, and persistent Bash history
* Add **Settings > Power Mode** to optimize the system for power efficiency, balanced, or performance
* Hover over an entry on **Tools** and **Settings** to favorite an item, quickly get back to it on the new top-level **Favorites** page
